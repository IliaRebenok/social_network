The idea of this project is to make sort of a copy of the existing social network "VK.com". 
During the proccess of implementing of this idea many important technologies were under practice.
Here is step-by-step how this project developed:
- Firstly the static page was created with only HTML + CSS.
- New project was created by using "create-react-app"
- Buildin the UI with creating component based page
- Added routing feature to mainpage, messages and photos pages(messages and photos pages will be developed later)
- Creating the wall posts as an array of objects and showing them on the page according to the wall state
- Added some interactions on the project(expanding text in the profile info, sorting the "wall-posts" by clicking corresponding buttons, deleting the posts from the wall)
- Starting to add TS features to the project
-
